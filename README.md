# web-design-AB-test

The goal of this project is to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new website in order to increase the number of users who buy its product, therefore, the objective of the project will be to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

# Data  

The data to be used are the following:

- **ab_data.csv**
Columns: user_id, timestamp, group, landing_page, converted.

- **countries.csv**
Columns: user_id, country.

# Conclusion

The experiment has only been carried out between January 2nd and 24th so the data may be affected by biases such as novelty effect or change aversion. Therefore, it seems that the best decision would be to **run the experiment for a longer period of time**.
